            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>Having a background of nearly 7 years working in children’s mental and behavioral health, I am passionate about helping kids who struggle with trauma and mental health problems. 
                During the pandemic I was introduced to an array of different apps and web programs meant for kids to help learn and grow using modern tools. 
                I watched my students accelerate their learning and learn new ways to help regulate with these apps. 
                On the flip side though it became increasingly clear there is a need for more programs aimed more at children who are functionally at their age level, but academically or behaviorally behind either due to trauma they’ve been through or underlying mental health problems, preventing them from achieving their fullest. 
                I want to work with companies to help develop and make these programs to help these children flourish and reach their full potential.</p>
 
               <p>In my free time I can be found crafting with friends, watching mysteries with my family, or spoiling my nephew rotten.
            </p>
